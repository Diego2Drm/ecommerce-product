## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - JS library
- [React Image Gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery) - NPM

### What I learned

```Jsx -createContext-
import React, { createContext, useState } from "react";

const ShoppingShoesContext = createContext();

const ShoppingShoesProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [shoesCount, setShoesCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <ShoppingShoesContext.Provider
      value={{
        shoesCount,
        setShoesCount,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ShoppingShoesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export { ShoppingShoesProvider };
export { ShoppingShoesContext };
```

```css
    CSS Modules
    import style from "./index.module.css"
    <section className={style.layout}>{children}</section>;
```

### Continued development

- CSS Modules

### Useful resources
